        "Taylor Swift has capped off a stellar 2023 by being named Time Magazine's person of the year. The star, whose Eras tour broke box office records and provoked an inquiry into Ticketmaster's sales practices, follows the likes of Barack Obama, Greta Thunberg and Volodymyr Zelensky. She told the magazine that she is \"the proudest and happiest I've ever felt\". The award goes to an event or person deemed to have had the most influence on global events over the past year. The singer also admitted to the magazine that the toll of her 180-minute Eras concerts often left her feeling physically exhausted. After a run of shows, \"I do not leave my bed except to get food and take it back to my bed and eat it there,\" she said. \"I can barely speak because I've been singing for three shows straight. Every time I take a step my feet go crunch, crunch, crunch from dancing in heels.\" The star also talked about her blossoming romance with American Football star Travis Kelce. The couple hit the headlines in September when Swift was spotted at with Kelce's mother at one of his games. \"By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple,\" she explained, adding they had first hooked up over the summer. \"I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard-launch a first date.\" But Swift's love life is small beans compared to her cultural impact. Already a superstar before 2023, her career has reached new heights thanks to the Eras tour - which sees the singer perform a career-spanning 45-song set every night. Demand for tickets was so high that it crashed Ticketmaster's website, prompting a hearing into its business practices by the US Senate. When the tour began in the summer, ticketless fans gathered in car parks just to hear the music. In Seattle, her concerts generated seismic activity equivalent to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake. \"It feels like the breakthrough moment of my career, happening at 33,\" she told Time. \"And for the first time in my life, I was mentally tough enough to take what comes with that.\" Swift's imperial phase comes after a period where she was vilified for her positions on feminism and politics - although her silence on those issues stemmed from nothing more sinister than a lack of confidence. After speaking out against Donald Trump and in favour of abortion rights, she hit a creative purple patch with the pandemic-era albums Folklore and Evermore. Showcasing a more organic, indie-folk approach than the country-pop that made her famous, the records confirmed her status as a generational songwriting talent. She cemented her comeback with last year's Midnights - a bleary, sleep-deprived collection of pop songs based around the thoughts that keep her up at night.\n",

        "A royal author has claimed that Meghan Markle could be dropped by her talent agency because of Omid Scobie’s new controversial book, Endgame: Inside the Royal Family and the Monarchy’s Fight for Survival. Angela Levin, while speaking to GB News, said that Patrick Christys that William Morris Endeavour is “horrified” imagining what consequences the Sussex brand could have as a result of the book.\n",
        "Angela said that the controversy around the race row can affect Meghan, and she might as well be dropped by the agency. “They said they were ‘horrified’, that can’t just be about the two names that were mentioned, it must be about their client, Meghan,” she said. “It seems to me that they will think very carefully what they do next. I have never heard such a well known agency be clear with how they Angela added, \"Meghan needs to be very careful. A lot of people have dropped her. The agency have told her to ‘stop moaning’, because people are ‘getting fed up’ with it. If they know feel they have an even harder job to do in order to get her famous, it’s going to be difficult.”\n",
        "On being asked if Meghan may be dropped by the talent agency, Angela responded, “Yes.” “It is going to be very difficult to get the glamour she wants”, she said.\n",
        "The controversy arose after two “racist” royals were named in the Dutch edition of Omid Scobie’s new book. The book was released on Tuesday, November 28. Later, the book was removed from the shelves across the Netherlands. It will reportedly be back on the shelves again on December 8.\n",
        "Back in March 2021, Meghan, who is biracial, told Oprah Winfrey during an interview that a member of the family had said something about “how dark” Archie’s skin would be when he was born. Archie was born in May 2019.\n",
